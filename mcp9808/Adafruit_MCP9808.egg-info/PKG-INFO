Description: DEPRECATED LIBRARY Adafruit Python MCP9808
        ===================
        
        This library has been deprecated!
        
        we are now only using our circuitpython sensor libraries in python
        
        we are leaving the code up for historical/research purposes but archiving the repository.
        
        check out this guide for using the mcp9808 with python!

        Python library for accessing the MCP9808 precision temperature sensor on a Raspberry Pi or Beaglebone Black.
        
        Designed specifically to work with the Adafruit MCP9808 sensor ----> https://www.adafruit.com/product/1782
        
        To install, first make sure some dependencies are available by running the following commands (on a Raspbian
        or Beaglebone Black Debian install):
        
        ````
        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install build-essential python-dev python-smbus
        ````
        
        Then download the library by clicking the download zip link to the right and unzip the archive somewhere on your Raspberry Pi or Beaglebone Black.  Then execute the following command in the directory of the library:
        
        ````
        sudo python setup.py install
        ````
        
        Make sure you have internet access on the device so it can download the required dependencies.
        
        See examples of usage in the examples folder.
